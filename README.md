# Wave-propagation-in-disordered-mass-spring-networks
The MATLAB-based code simulates the dynamic response of randomly perturbed triangular mass-spring networks to a dynamic harmonic excitation applied at the center of the left-hand side boundary. Periodic boundary conditions are applied on the top and bottom faces to avoid unnecessary wave scattering.

To run the code, copy all the files in the same folder and run 'Main.m'
